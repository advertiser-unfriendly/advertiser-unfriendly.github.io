## About Us
Hello World, Nepenthe here! I'm a Level 20+ Human multiclassing in data analytics, genre fiction writing, literary analysis, and zinemaking. It's 2022, time to put my money where my mouth is! Come hell or high water, I'll be publishing my creative journey during my final year of college, with the aim of building a proper portfolio of work by 2023.
