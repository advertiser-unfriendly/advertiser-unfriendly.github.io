# Major Memorial Day Updates

## AU Publications

    Part I of [Hallowed Book 1](/Hallowed) is fully drafted! That's 25% of the first draft complete, and I will post again once we hit 50% (Part II Completion). At that point, I (Nepenthe) will begin writing the FINAL DRAFT of Hallowed Book 1 ðŸ˜Ž while Respite begins working with Ridley on visual assets :D That's right, folks, this b!tch is gonna be ILLUSTRATED! We also are currently workshopping Part III, as that is the most muddy and undefined section of the novel thus far. Wish us luck!

    Check out Ridley, Respite, and I's author bios [here](/HallowedAuthors), too!

## Site Maintenance
    Updated all pages on the site, updated links to match the changed and fresh paths, cleaned up the [tumblr](https://advertiser-unfriendly.tumblr.com) for zine hosting, and created a new Blog index. Reformatted the licensing for the blog, since we are offiically hosting IP (and even set up some "invisible" pages for an upcoming AU Publications project...keep your eyes peeled) Linked the project timeline to this website, finally, and that's all! I must've pushed, like, a gazillion commits to the main branch today. that's enough for one month! Nepenthe runs us through the wringer sometimes, eh?


Happy Memorial Day, all!

Whimsically Yours,
Respite & Nepenthe
